## Who can contribute ?

A common misconception about contributing to open source is that you need to contribute code. In fact, it’s often the other parts of a project that are most neglected or overlooked. You’ll do the project a huge favour by offering to pitch in with these types of contributions!
Even if you like to write code, other types of contributions are a great way to get involved with a project and meet other community members. Building those relationships will give you opportunities to work on other parts of the project.
*Basically everybody can contribute*

## How can I contribute ?
* Reporting Bugs
* Documentation
* Improvements suggestions

## Steps in contributing

 * ### Clone this project to your local machine.

    ```
* ### Make necessary changes & commit.
    ```bash
    $ git add --all
    $ git commit -m "This is a commit message"
